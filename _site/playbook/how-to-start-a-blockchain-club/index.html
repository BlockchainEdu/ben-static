<h4 id="bring-a-speaker-to-your-campus">Bring a Speaker to your Campus</h4>
<ul>
  <li>There are many best practices to consider when bringing a speaker to your campus.</li>
  <li>Think of your audience and ask the speaker to coordinate how difficult/easy it will be to</li>
  <li>Gauge expected engagement and plan the size of the room accordingly. An event with 10 people in a room that fits 100 looks embarrassing. A room with 10 people that fits 10 works. Not having a lot of people is okay, lying about it is not. If you don’t have many people, set expectations with your speaker that it will be a more intimate event with a few number of people.</li>
  <li>Consider asking the company your speaker represents to cover costs of food for the event.</li>
  <li>Coordinate so food arrives at the END of the talk. People who take food at the beginning might try to eat and run.</li>
</ul>

<p>BEN is in contact with tons of speakers across the blockchain space. Reach out to learn more.</p>
