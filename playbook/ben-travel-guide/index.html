#### Introduction
###### Traveling alone or for the first time can be intimidating, so BEN has your back. After having our fair share of things forgotten, over heavy bags, missed flights, lost airbnb keys, being mugged, last minute visas/flight booking/hotel booking, and traveling solo… we are here to prepare you for anything.

#### Step 1 - Create a Budget
###### Below is an excel file with an already made budget template and examples for you to fill out when traveling alone or in a group.

#### Step 2 - Book Your Flight
###### We recommend using [Skiplagged.com](https://skiplagged.com). We’ve always found it has the lowest prices.
###### When flying internationally ALWAYS GET TRAVELERS INSURANCE, we recommend to buy separately with [Allianz](https://allianztravelinsurance.com/compare-plans).
###### Check if it’s any cheaper to fly in a couple days before or flying iout a couple days later and compare to the cost of the hotel/airbnb to stay those extra nights. We have saved $150/person by doing so.
###### Double check whether you are allowed to bring a carry on onto the flight.
###### After booking your flights, MAKE SURE EVERYONE GOES ONLINE AND UPDATES THEIR TRAVELERS INFO WITH PASSPORT ETC. Pick your seats near each other

#### Step 3 - Book Your Stay
###### Lodging: Compare [Airbnb](airbnb.com) prices with [Expedia](expedia.com) & Hotel Tonight
###### Buying 1 or two days before, Expedia/Hotel Tonight tends to be cheaper
###### Book the place with a max 10/15 min walk away from the conference, this way you save on ubers and travel
###### When booking an airbnb make sure it is an entire place, with wifi, laundry -will allow you to pack light, and a first floor/ place with an elevator will make a significant impact on your trip
###### Make sure your check in and check out work with your flight schedule, if they do not match, reach out to the airbnb host/hotel beforehand to see what accomodations can be made.
###### If both hotels and airbnbs are too expensive try breaking up the days you’re there and book different airbnbs, we recommend a max 2-3 airbnbs.

**LAST TRAVEL TIPS:**
* Create a key spot- airbnb lost key fees can be very expensive and being locked out is not fun, you’ll be lucky to find an open window
* If you’re traveling alone reach out to the BEN community and we’ll make sure to connect you to someone we know there
* Find a local coffee spot that has wifi and outlets, this will help if you’re ever locked out, unable to connect to wifi, meeting someone, or serve as a meetup if anyone gets lost

#### International Travel
* Cell-phone international plans *
Make sure you update the budget template while looking at your cell-phone min and data cost.
* Verizon tends to charge $10/day for call and text, which can add up
* Sprint chargers $.25/min, $5/day for data, and $25/7 days for data
* If you’re thinking of getting a sim card DOUBLE CHECK with your carrier that your phone will work with one. We recommend Vodafone when traveling to Europe and Claro when traveling to Latin America. Plans are around $15/3gb to $30/10gb.

##### Know the must knows
* Address where you will be arriving
* Phone number of the person/hotel where you will be staying
* American embassy phone number and location
* 911 phone number in the country you’re staying in

##### Know how to say the following in the language you’re going to
+ Help
+ Do you speak english?
+ Call the police
+ I am hurt
+ I am lost
+ I am going to...
+ I am coming from…
+ Where is…
+ I am allergic to…
+ Where is the bathroom?
+ How much?
+ Do you have a phone charger?
