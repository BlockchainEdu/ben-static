#### Introduction
A bitcoin airdrop prompts campus bitcoin, blockchain, and fintech clubs to actively promote themselves by giving away free bitcoin. The goal of an airdrop is to attract as many people as possible and encourage them to download digital wallets so they may be given their first taste of using crypto. The event may serve as the kick-off party for respective clubs for the school year and its success may allow bitcoin to gain a presence at more universities and academic institutions across the globe.

#### When to do an Airdrop
Airdrops should be held concurrently with respective universitiesâ€™ Orientation Weeks or Clubs Weeks to achieve the most exposure for the club as possible. Consider timing the airdrop around a significant blockchain event, such as a bull market during peak hype or during Bitcoin's anniversary (October 31st).


#### Distribution Method
Organizers have a good deal of flexibility when organizing an airdrop. Organizers could encourage participants to download mobile digital wallets, like Coinbase Wallet or use online paper wallets such as bitaddress.org. The only goal is to try and encourage as much participation as possible. This may be done in a variety of ways.
You could partner with an existing campus event. This may include collaboration with other student clubs or perhaps with the university itself. The benefit of choosing this option is that logistical planning is streamlined. Airdrop organizers could then also tap into larger portions of the student population who may be expected to turn out for these events.

##### Way 1: Host a meetup
This meetup could be formal in nature, offering up a presentation and information about blockchain (like our Blockchain 101). Attendants could then be given free bitcoin for choosing to come. However, the event could also be done informally instead taking place at a campus community centre or pub with a booth.
* On the spot. Tell people that you are airdropping Bitcoin. If they are interested, walk them through the process right there with them and send free Bitcoin to their new wallet. This is how the bIITcoin airdrop
* Sealed Envelopes with paper wallets and an education package contained inside. Include a tutorial on how to import funds from a paper wallet and a guide on wallet security best practices. This is how McGill University did their airdrop.
* Goodies like bitcoin cupcakes. Put a paper wallet QR Code on top of or under each cupcake. Include a flyer with instructionals for how to redeem.


##### Way 2: Campus Wide Scavenger Hunt
Hide Bitcoin paper wallets on various locations around campus. This option provides for an interactive and immersive experience instead of merely just handing out crypto. Winners of the hunt could then be offered a larger portion of the purse to incentivize participation. Mobile applications such as Takara offer the ability to geocache bitcoin at various locations across the university of academic institution.

##### Way 3: Online Airdrop
An online campaign could be employed where attendees or participants post their addresses and bitcoin is transferred after the fact. The MIT Bitcoin Club's airdrop was done entirely online. Students had to complete a survey which included their bitcoin address and then were sent $100 worth of bitcoin to their address.

##### Way 4: Mix online and offline
The University of Florida chapter did a Facebook event for their airdrop. Attendees posted their bitcoin address as a comment. If the RSVPer showed up to the event, they liked the post and sent the Bitcoin to the address.

#### How much bitcoin do I need?
The amount of bitcoin you need may vary. The more students you plan on airdropping to, the less you'll be able to give per student. Consider giving bitcoin proportional to effort. Are you handing out paper wallet on the street? Give $1-$3 worth of bitcoin at most. Are students filling out a survey and receiving the Bitcoin only after attending 2-3 club meetings? Be more generous with $5-10 worth of bitcoin.

Whatever you do, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH BITCOIN ALLOCATED FOR THE AIRDROP. Have your airdrop partners, if any, send Bitcoin to your wallet well before the event.

#### Promoting the Airdrop
Promotion may be dealt with in various ways. You can post flyers across campus. Organizers may advertise through social media channels, get in the local news. If partnering with pre-existing campus events or clubs, organizers may also choose to utilize their promotional methods.

#### After the Airdrop
Don't lose engagement! Have students sign up to join your club after the airdrop. Give opportunities for students to use their bitcoin on campus! Host sessions for students to learn how they can buy more bitcoin and spend their bitcoin online.
