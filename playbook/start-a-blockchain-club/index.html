#### Introduction
While it is not necessary to start or be a part of a blockchain club at your school to be a BEN member, it is a great way to bring together your local community to learn and teach each other about blockchain. BEN has helped start and grow blockchain clubs at universities across the world and can provide a lot of guidance in organizing your club.  


##### Registering Your Club
* The club leaders should be currently enrolled students.
* Set up a new entity at your university, officially register with your university.
* 2 members as core team, 1 member in training. At least one member should be technical
* Have a plan of action (manifesto, analysis of the state of blockchain in your region, what your club would like to do)
* ‚Äã[Sample Constitution‚Äã](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1axi7tOWUFoOC1SR2pVeGtNS0U/view?usp=sharing)
* Sign a no harassment policy
* Aim to hold at least one meetup every two months.
* Commit to sharing resources and materials for other clubs that need it.
* ‚ÄãOnboard all of your members as BEN members.‚Äã
* Keep BEN up to date with your events, goals, plans, and changes in leadership.

##### Functions of a Club leader
* Drive the growth of the blockchain community on your campus.
* Club meetings should be weld weekly or bi-weekly
* Every meetup is well defined
* Agenda is required ‚Üí share with core team
* Have the members well informed and share some resources about the next agenda

##### The First Meeting
* Before the first meeting, ask students to watch ‚ÄúIntroduction to Bitcoin‚Äù
* At the first meeting, ask who watched the video?
+ Those who raised their hands are your first movers
* After the first meeting, ask students to watch Mastering Bitcoin

##### The First Two Months
* Educate members on blockchain fundamentals.
* Lead lessons using the companion slides from our Playbook.

##### After Two Months
* Encourage students to tackle on developer plays.
* Aim to tackle at least one community play per semester.

##### Club Meeting Format

* 0-10 minutes:
+ Introductions and small talk as people arrive.
* 10-15 minutes:
 + Person by person introductions, Each person states their:
  - Name
  - Where they are from
  - How they heard of / became involved with blockchain.
  - Interests they‚Äôd like to pursue in the blockchain world.
  - Fun question - ‚ÄúAre you Satoshi?‚Äù
* 45-90 minutes:
+ Open floor dialogue
  - Members continue to speak of meetup topics as a whole
  - Members speak in smaller groups & individually
  - Leaders help new members get set up with a Bitcoin wallet and other first timer events

##### Running a Booth at a Club Fair
* Set up a booth with flyers about your club.
* Bring a miner! Set it up and be prepared to ask questions about hash fair
* Do a bitcoin airdrop?
* Be prepared for Bitcoin skeptics - have a sheet w/ common questions about bitcoin handy to give out

##### Bring a Speaker to your Campus
* There are many best practices to consider when bringing a speaker to your campus.
* Think of your audience and ask the speaker to coordinate how difficult/easy it will be to
* Gauge expected engagement and plan the size of the room accordingly. An event with 10 people in a room that fits 100 looks embarrassing. A room with 10 people that fits 10 works. Not having a lot of people is okay, lying about it is not. If you don't have many people, set expectations with your speaker that it will be a more intimate event with a few number of people.
* Consider asking the company your speaker represents to cover costs of food for the event.
* Coordinate so food arrives at the END of the talk. People who take food at the beginning might try to eat and run.

BEN is in contact with tons of speakers across the blockchain space. Reach out to learn more.
